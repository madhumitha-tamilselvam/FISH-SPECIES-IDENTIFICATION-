# FISH-SPECIES-IDENTIFICATION-
ABSTRACT:
This project is provided to identify the species of the fish. This project is very helpful for the fishermen and sellers in the fish market. A high accuracy fish classification is required for greater understanding of fish 
behaviour in Ichthyology and by marine biologists. The technique we used, is deep learning as we used image to classify the fish species identification. This technology is fully based on softwaretechnique. In this project,
we just did a method such that when the particular image is placed it will show the name of the fish species. The majority of available methods focus on theclassification of fishes outside of water because underwater 
classification poses challenges such as background noise, distortion of images, the presence of other water bodies in images, image quality and occlusion. The advantage of this project is that the fishermen can make use 
of this and can identify the species of the fish. Here our accuracy is 99.33%. To our knowledge, this is one of the best reported results on fish datasets, which will show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.
